            For <b> Front-End </b>, my favorite technology / library is <b> React.js </b>. In addition, it is the one that I have developed the most and have gone the furthest in recent years.
            I really like to program with React. <br /> For the most knowledgeable, I love programming <i> functional components </i>. Both project and code are well structured and clean.
            <br /> <b> Redux </b>, <i> Context </i>, <i> Hooks </i>, <i> React-Router </i>, <i> React-Springs </i> ... are some of the tools that I use when programming.

            For the <b> Back-End </b>, I usually use <b> Laravel </b> as the <i> framework </i>, but I've also programmed with <b> CodeIgniter </b>. <br /> Management of <b> databases </b>, <b>user
            authentication</b> or <b> using public and custom APIs </b> are some of the things I can do.
